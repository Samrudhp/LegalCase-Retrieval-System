## 🚀 Quick Navigation

Each phase builds upon the previous one, providing a complete understanding of:

1. **What** the system does (Phase 1)
2. **How** the AI/ML works (Phase 2)
3. **How** the backend is engineered (Phase 3)
4. **How** the frontend provides user experience (Phase 4)
5. **How** it's deployed and scaled (Phase 5)
6. **How** everything works together (Phase 6)

## 📝 Reading Guide

- **For AI/ML Focus**: Start with Phase 1, dive deep into Phase 2, then review Phase 6
- **For Software Engineering Focus**: Phase 1 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
- **For DevOps/Cloud Focus**: Phase 1 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
- **For Complete Understanding**: Read all phases sequentially
